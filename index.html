          An audit is a systematic and independent examination of books,
          accounts, statutory records, documents and vouchers of an organization
          to ascertain how far the financial statements as well as non-financial
          disclosures present a true and fair view of the concern. It also
          attempts to ensure that the books of accounts are properly maintained
          by the concern as required by law. Auditing has become such a
          ubiquitous phenomenon in the corporate and the public sector that
          academics started identifying an "Audit Society"

            Due to strong incentives (including taxation, misselling and other
            forms of fraud) to misstate financial information, auditing has
            become a legal requirement for many entities who have the power to
            exploit financial information for personal gain. Traditionally,
            audits were mainly associated with gaining information about
            financial systems and the financial records of a company or a
            business. Financial audits are performed to ascertain the validity
            and reliability of information, as well as to provide an assessment
            of a system's internal control. As a result of this, a third party
            can express an opinion of the person / organization / system (etc.)
            in question. The opinion given on financial statements will depend
            on the audit evidence obtained.

          Auditors of financial statements & non-financial information
          (including compliance audit) can be classified into three categories:
          External auditor/Statutory auditor is an independent firm engaged by
          the client subject to the audit to express an opinion on whether the
          company's financial statements are free of material misstatements,
          whether due to fraud or error. For publicly traded companies, external
          auditors may also be required to express an opinion on the
          effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. External
          auditors may also be engaged to perform other agreed-upon procedures,
          related or unrelated to financial statements. Most importantly,
          external auditors, though engaged and paid by the company being
          audited, should be regarded as independent and remain third
          party.[citation needed] Cost auditor/Statutory cost auditor is an
          independent firm engaged by the client subject to the cost audit to
          express an opinion on whether the company's cost statements and cost
          sheet are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or
          error. For publicly traded companies, external auditors may also be
          required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal
          controls over cost reporting. These are Specialized Persons called
          Cost Accountants in India & CMA globally either Cost & Management
          Accountants or Certified Management Accountants.
